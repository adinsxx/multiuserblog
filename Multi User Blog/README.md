Hello! 

This is a multi-user blog that allows memebers to log-in, post content, commments, edit both, and a couple other awesome features!

Follow these instructions to run the program locally!

<ol>
    
<li>Download and install python 2.7 (that can be done here! https://www.python.org/downloads/)</li>

(copy and paste this link into your seach bar: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python)</li>
   
<li>Download the Zip file for this Repository or Clone it(if you know how) to your Desktop</li>
    
<li>Using a command line program (I use windows, so I use Command Prompt), change the directory to the folder you just downloaded (Like this <code>cd /Users/Desktop/multi-user-blog</code>
)</li>
 
<li> Your command line should look something like this now: <code>C:\Users\Your username\Desktop\Multi User Blog></code>
<li> Now add the following code after that and hit enter <code>dev_appserver.py .</code>
 (don't forget that space and period, very important to get it running!)</li>
